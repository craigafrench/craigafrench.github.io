This is a minimalistic personal website.

Its design as a Jekyll site is based on the personal pages of the [Wayward Wild](http://waywardwild.com) team. When creating the Jekyll template files using Liquid markup, I started building from their code. (Specifically, most of the CSS is taken over, I changed some of the dependencies and scripting, and added YAML functionality.) 

There are several things to iron out still, and I'll create [issues](https://github.com/msteenhagen/msteenhagen.github.io/issues) to keep track of them.
