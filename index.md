Welcome to my homepage! I'm Craig French, pictured with Poppy (I'll leave you to work out who is who). 

I'm the [WYNG](http://wyng.hk/wp/) Research Fellow in Philosophy at [Trinity Hall](http://www.trinhall.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk). In September 2016 I'll be joining the [Department of Philosophy at the University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/philosophy/index.aspx) as an Assistant Professor.

My main areas of research and teaching are the philosophy of mind & psychology and metaphysics & epistemology. I also have a strong interest in various aspects of the history of philosophy. To find out more about my work please see my [Research Page](http://craigafrench.github.io/research/) and my [CV](http://craigafrench.github.io/assets/CraigFrenchCV.pdf). My [Talks Page](http://craigafrench.github.io/talks/) has a list of recent and upcoming talks.

To get in touch please send me an [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}). If you would like to see some of my photos -- of friends, dogs, books, Cambridge, etc -- then please add me on [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/craigfrench1) or [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/craigfrench/albums).

This website is based on that of my philosopher friend [Maarten Steenhagen](http://msteenhagen.github.io/).
