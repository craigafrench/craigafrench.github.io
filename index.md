Welcome! I'm the WYNG Research Fellow in Philosophy at [Trinity Hall](http://www.trinhall.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk). I'm also a Postdoctoral Research Fellow on Cambridge's exciting new philosophy of mind project: [New Directions in the Study of the Mind](http://www.newdirectionsproject.com) funded by the [John Templeton Foundation](http://www.templeton.org/).

My main areas of research and teaching are the philosophy of mind & psychology and metaphysics & epistemology. I also have a strong interest in various aspects of the history of philosophy.
