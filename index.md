Maarten Steenhagen is a philosopher, writer and coffee lover known for his wild ideas about images.

From July 2015 onwards he will be a postdoctoral fellow in [Bence Nanay](http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/bence.nanay/)'s research group at the University of Antwerp. He has a Ph.D. in philosophy from [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy), and recently was a visiting researcher at the [University of Toronto](http://www.philosophy.utoronto.ca).

Maarten thinks and writes about current developments in philosophy of mind and perception, psychology, and the history of analytic philosophy.

In his doctoral work, [_Appearance and Representation_](http://msteenhagen.github.io/Appearance-and-representation/), he defends a new approach to images. (How? Images allow us to perceive what they represent, because they can function in vision the way sounds do in audition.)

Maarten gives frequent [talks](http://msteenhagen.github.io/talks/). He can be reached via [email](mailto:m.steenhagen@mail.utoronto.ca) or shouted at on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/msteenhagen).
