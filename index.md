Welcome! I'm the WYNG Research Fellow in Philosophy at [Trinity Hall](http://www.trinhall.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge[(http://www.cam.ac.uk)]. I'm also a Postdoctoral Research Fellow on Cambridge's exciting new philosophy of mind project: [New Directions in the Study of the Mind](http://www.newdirectionsproject.com).

My main areas of research and teaching are the philosophy of mind & psychology, epistemology, and the history of early modern philosophy. These link up in my work as I want to understand core aspects of our mental lives such as perceiving and knowing, and I want to consider these matters with an eye on the rich insights to be found in the philosophies of the early modern period.
