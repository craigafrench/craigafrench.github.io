Welcome! I'm the WYNG Research Fellow in Philosophy at [Trinity Hall](http://www.trinhall.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk). I'm also a Postdoctoral Research Fellow on an exciting new philosophy of mind project: [New Directions in the Study of the Mind](http://www.newdirectionsproject.com) funded by the [John Templeton Foundation](http://www.templeton.org/) and based at Cambridge's [Faculty of Philosophy](http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk).

My main areas of research and teaching are the philosophy of mind & psychology and metaphysics & epistemology. I also have a strong interest in various aspects of the history of philosophy. To find out more about my work please see my [research page](http://craigafrench.github.io/research/) and my [CV](http://craigafrench.github.io/assets/CraigFrenchCV.pdf). And see [here](http://craigafrench.github.io/talks) for a list of recent and upcoming talks.

To get in touch please send me an [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or follow me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/earlymodphil). If you would like to see some of my photos -- of friends, dogs, books, Cambridge, etc -- then please add me on [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/craigfrench1) or [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/craigfrench/albums).
